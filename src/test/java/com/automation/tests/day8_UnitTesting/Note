Agenda: TESTNG

levels of testing:

    unit- testing of smallest functional piece of the application. For example : method of class
    unit testing is done by developers

    integration

    system

    UAT

    In my project, developers were following this flow:

developers write a code --> unit tests to test their code --> code review
--> new build can be deployed to the test env --> and here we do functional testing

Who writes unit tests? For application code - developres.

Can I write some unit tests for my automation framework? yes
